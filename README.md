Modular Air Quality Monitoring System

# About the Project

IoT-based modular air quality monitoring system as the name suggests is a project based on IoT(Internet of Things). There are more than 10 gas sensors that can be incorporated into this project, detecting the air quality of the immediate surrounding. It can see a huge range of harmful gases if they cross their permissible limits. It is made modular, which makes it customisable. Customers can use any sensor according to their convenience and need. This feature makes it pocket friendly. A web application will be there where the user will be given the option to choose the sensor which was bought, accordingly, the unique code will be updated in the userâ€™s system and server space will be allocated, the data can be tracked using the linked smartphone from the comfort of our homes. A GPS module will be installed which will give us the live data of the location, thus if any danger is detected then some immediate help can be sent. This can be used in places prone to gas leakage like petrol pumps, pesticide plants, chemical factories, industries and even in homes. 

## OBJECT OF INVENTION

The IoT-based air quality monitoring system makes an interwoven network of devices that enables us to send timely help to that specific location. It is modular, thus very flexible and handy as it is customizable and portable. This gives a real-time analysis of the immediate surrounding of the machine. This device is also very reasonable thus without giving loads on the pockets of the common public.

## A SUMMARY OF INVENTION

IoT-based modular air quality monitoring system is a product that enhances the connectivity of this device with our smartphones very easily. We can control or rather analyze the real-time immediate surrounding air quality using our phones. The product is made modular, which gives the user the scope to use sensor modules as per their needs. They may use specific sensors according to their surroundings. The sensors once plugged in, the users can choose the port name from the web application. According to the port name and the sensor used the system will work and store the proper data in the server space allocated for that particular user for a considerable amount of time like one month. We have a built-in temperature and humidity sensor, if the user does not buy any sensor, then they can choose to see the temperature and the humidity only.

FIG1: Here in this diagram, we show our main HUB and the modules connected to it. Our HUB contains ESP8266 Node MCU and 16 analog Multiplexer which allows us to connect our 16 modules to our main HUB.
Each Module is connected via a USB port and the user can put it in by their own choice. 
On top of the HUB, there is a power chord which will power our whole Device. We require Wi-Fi to establish a connection with Our device and smartphone.

FIG2: It represents our Block Diagram, that power flows from the HUB to the modules and all the information that the modules receive is sent to our Smartphones via Cloud. As a result, we get a display of the Air Quality on our smartphones.

## CLAIMS

```python
1.	Internet of Things-based product which provides easy connectivity with the smartphone. 

2.	Modular approach which makes it customisable.

3.	the Huge number of sensors up to 16 sensors can be used together at a time thus providing accuracy.

4.	This product is portable as the size of this device is smaller than the cliched air monitors.

5.	Web application usage where the user will have the freedom to choose any port according to their wish in which they want to plug in the sensor. 
The web application will work accordingly then.

6.	Providing server space for storing air quality data for a considerable amount of time.

7.	Send an audio notification and an email when the hazardous gases cross their permissible limits.
