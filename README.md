# AERO

The air we breathe plays a crucial role in our overall well-being, and the quality of the air is directly linked to our health. However, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and various human activities have led to a significant increase in air pollution levels. To address this issue and empower individuals with the ability to monitor and analyze the air quality in their immediate surroundings, we have developed an innovative project - an IoT-based modular air quality monitoring system. 

## OBJECT OF INVENTION

The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly, affordable, and portable solution that enables real-time analysis and monitoring of air quality. By leveraging IoT technology and modular sensor components, our system allows users to customize their monitoring setup and obtain accurate measurements of various atmospheric components.

## Features
The project incorporates several key features that set it apart from existing air monitoring systems:

# IoT Connectivity:
The system is designed to establish a seamless connection between the monitoring device and users' smartphones. This connectivity enables users to remotely monitor air quality, receive timely notifications, and access historical data.

# Modularity:
Our device adopts a modular approach, providing users with the flexibility to select and use specific sensor modules based on their requirements. This allows for a customizable monitoring experience tailored to different environments and pollutants of interest.

# Sensor Accuracy:
The project supports the use of up to 16 sensor modules simultaneously, enhancing the accuracy of measurements. Users can select from a range of gas sensors, including those for ozone, methane, butane, carbon monoxide, LPG, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen, among others.

# Portability:
Unlike traditional air monitoring systems that are often bulky and stationary, our project focuses on portability. The compact size of our device enables users to easily transport and install it in various locations, expanding its accessibility and usability.

# Web Application:
We have developed a user-friendly web application that allows individuals to configure their sensor modules. Users can choose specific ports on the main hub to connect their desired sensors, enabling a seamless integration process. The web application also provides graphical representations and gas meters to visualize the air quality data collected by the system.

# Data Storage:
To ensure comprehensive data analysis and historical tracking, we provide server space for users to store air quality data collected by the system. Users can access this data for a considerable amount of time, enabling long-term analysis and trend identification.

# Alert System:
Our monitoring system is equipped with an alert system that sends audio notifications and emails to users when hazardous gases exceed their permissible limits. This immediate notification helps users take precautionary measures, evacuate if necessary, and respond promptly to potential dangers.



## Benefits and Applications
The IoT-based modular air quality monitoring system offers numerous benefits and finds applications in various sectors, including:

# Public Safety:
The system provides real-time analysis of air quality, making it invaluable for people living near factories, petroleum stations, or in areas prone to high pollution levels. By detecting harmful gases and sending timely alerts, it helps safeguard individuals from gas poisoning and potential health risks.

# Environmental Monitoring:
The project contributes to environmental conservation by promoting awareness and understanding of air pollution levels. It enables users to track changes in air quality over time, aiding efforts to identify pollution sources, implement mitigation strategies, and work towards cleaner environments.

# Occupational Safety:
The system can be utilized in occupational settings where workers may be exposed to hazardous gases. By monitoring and alerting against the presence of harmful substances, it enhances workplace safety measures, protecting employees from potential health hazards.

# Residential Applications:
Individuals leaving their homes unattended for extended periods can utilize the system to monitor the air quality inside their residences. This helps ensure a healthy living environment, detect any gas leakage issues, and take necessary actions to prevent accidents or property damage.
