                <h1>Technologies Used</h1>
                <h2> Kalman Filtering: </h2>
                <p>Kalman filtering is an algorithm used in our IoT-based air quality monitoring system to improve the accuracy and reliability of sensor measurements. 
                    It is a recursive algorithm that estimates the true state of a system based on a series of noisy observations. 
                    The Kalman filter considers both the current sensor measurement and the predicted state of the system to generate an optimal estimate of the true state.
                    <br>
                    The Kalman filter consists of two main steps: the prediction step and the update step. 
                    In the prediction step, the filter predicts the next state of the system based on the previous state estimate and the system dynamics. 
                    This prediction takes into account factors such as sensor noise and system uncertainties.
                    <br>
                    The update step incorporates the new sensor measurement into the prediction to refine the state estimate. 
                    The Kalman filter calculates the Kalman gain, which determines how much the measurement should be weighted in the estimation process. 
                    By iteratively repeating these steps, the filter continuously updates and refines its estimate of the true state.
                    <br>
                    The formulas used in the Kalman filter include:
                    <br>
                    Prediction step:
                    <br>
                    State prediction: x̂ₖ = Fxₖ₋₁ + Buₖ₋₁
                    Covariance prediction: Pₖ = FPFᵀ + Q
                    Update step:
                    <br>
                    Kalman gain: Kₖ = PHᵀ / (HPHᵀ + R)
                    State update: xₖ = x̂ₖ + Kₖ(yₖ - Hx̂ₖ)
                    Covariance update: Pₖ = (I - KH)Pₖ
                    Here, xₖ represents the true state of the system at time step k, x̂ₖ is the estimated state, F is the state transition matrix, B is the control input matrix, 
                    uₖ is the control input, Pₖ is the state covariance matrix, Q is the process noise covariance matrix, H is the measurement matrix, yₖ is the sensor measurement, 
                    R is the measurement noise covariance matrix, and I is the identity matrix.
                    <br>
                    By applying the Kalman filter algorithm to the sensor measurements in our air quality monitoring system, we can reduce noise, filter out uncertainties, 
                    and obtain more accurate and reliable estimates of atmospheric gas concentrations.

                <h2> IoT and MQTT Protocol: </h2>
                <p>In our air quality monitoring system, we leverage the Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enable seamless connectivity and communication between the 
                    monitoring device and users' smartphones or other devices. To achieve this, we utilize the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol.
                    <br>
                    The MQTT protocol is a lightweight and efficient messaging protocol designed for IoT applications. 
                    It follows a publish-subscribe model, where devices publish messages to a broker and other devices subscribe to specific topics to receive those messages. 
                    The MQTT protocol uses a client-server architecture, with the broker acting as the intermediary between publishers and subscribers.
                    <br>
                    The key components of the MQTT protocol include:
                    <br>
                    Broker: The MQTT broker is a server that receives messages published by devices and distributes them to the appropriate subscribers. 
                    It ensures efficient message routing and delivery.
                    <br>
                    Publisher: A device that publishes messages to specific topics on the broker. 
                    In our air quality monitoring system, the monitoring device acts as a publisher, sending sensor data to the broker.
                    <br>
                    Subscriber: A device that subscribes to specific topics on the broker to receive messages. 
                    In our system, users' smartphones or other devices act as subscribers, receiving air quality data from the broker.
                    <br>
                    The MQTT protocol offers several advantages for IoT applications, such as low bandwidth and resource requirements, support for asynchronous communication, 
                    and reliable message delivery. It allows real-time and bi-directional communication between devices, enabling users to receive timely updates on air quality parameters.
